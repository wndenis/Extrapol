# Extrapol
Nonlinear extrapolation in unity plus neat lighting and postprocessing  
> Project was made in 2018 and updated to Unity 2019.4.21f1  

Extrapolation code can be found here:

### How it works:
It uses Newton's extrapolation by 3 samples to predict parabola.
> Note: sometimes it can miss. Missing probability rises with distance.  
> Project assumes that only one bullet is affected by gravity - the second one considered to be linear.

1) Sampling during first 0.5 seconds after shot

2) Extrapolating parabola (vector3 by time), iterating over time offset in seconds from 0 (last known target position) to 1 (position in 1 second after) using small step to find best solution.

3) Successfully hit target üòç

### Also look at:
* Water reflections, which I just imported from one good unitypackage
* Baked lighting
* Water particles
* Nice postprocessing
